Managing the cost of large language models (LLMs) is a key concern for businesses and developers. With the right strategies, you can keep expenses predictable while still delivering high-quality AI experiences. Here's a practical guide to three essential techniques: token budgets, caching, and fallbacks.

## Step 1: Token Budgets – Set Clear Limits

LLMs are billed based on the number of tokens processed. To avoid unexpected costs:

- Define a maximum token budget per request or user session
- Monitor token usage in real time and alert users if they approach their limit
- Trim or summarize input data to stay within budget without losing important context

Setting token budgets helps you plan expenses and prevent runaway costs from unusually long prompts or conversations.

## Step 2: Caching – Reuse What You've Already Paid For

Many LLM queries are repeated or similar. Caching previous responses can save both time and money:

- Store responses to common queries in a fast-access cache
- Check the cache before sending a new request to the LLM
- Use cache invalidation rules to keep answers up to date

Effective caching reduces redundant API calls, speeds up response times, and lowers your overall LLM bill.

## Step 3: Fallbacks – Have a Backup Plan

Sometimes, LLM requests fail or exceed budget limits. Fallback strategies ensure a smooth user experience:

- Provide a simpler, rule-based response if the LLM is unavailable or too expensive
- Show a helpful message explaining the situation and suggesting next steps
- Log fallback events for later review and optimization

Fallbacks help maintain reliability and user trust, even when cost or technical limits are reached.

## Why These Strategies Work

- **Predictable Costs**: Token budgets keep spending under control
- **Efficiency**: Caching maximizes the value of each LLM call
- **Reliability**: Fallbacks ensure users always get a response, even in edge cases

By combining these three techniques, you can deliver powerful AI features without breaking the bank. [Contact our team](#) to learn how we can help you optimize your LLM implementation.

In today’s digital landscape, capturing leads efficiently is more important than ever. One of the most effective strategies we’ve seen is the “3-hop funnel” that moves users from TikTok to WhatsApp and finally to Checkout. Here’s how it works in detail:

## Step 1: TikTok – Attract and Engage

The journey begins on TikTok, a platform known for its viral short-form videos and massive reach. To make the most of this step:

- Create content that is visually appealing and directly addresses your target audience’s needs or pain points.
- Use storytelling, quick tips, or behind-the-scenes glimpses to build curiosity.
- Always include a clear call-to-action, such as “Message us for more info” or “Check the link in our bio.”
- Make sure your TikTok profile is optimized, with a compelling bio and a link that leads directly to your WhatsApp.

The goal here is to stop the scroll, spark interest, and motivate viewers to take the next step.

## Step 2: WhatsApp – Qualify and Nurture

Once a user clicks your profile link, they are taken straight to WhatsApp. This is where you can move from public engagement to private, one-on-one conversations:

- Set up automated welcome messages to greet new leads instantly.
- Use WhatsApp to answer questions, share more information, and address any concerns.
- Personalize your responses to make leads feel valued and understood.
- Share testimonials, product demos, or exclusive offers to build trust and move the conversation forward.

WhatsApp’s direct messaging format makes it easy to qualify leads, understand their needs, and nurture them toward a purchase decision.

## Step 3: Checkout – Convert

After building trust and addressing objections, guide your lead to the checkout page:

- Provide a direct link to your product or service checkout.
- Keep the checkout process as simple as possible—minimize the number of steps and required fields.
- Offer support during checkout in case the lead has last-minute questions or hesitations.
- Follow up with a thank-you message and next steps after the purchase is complete.

A smooth and transparent checkout experience increases the likelihood of conversion and leaves a positive impression.

## Why This Funnel Works

- **Low Friction:** Each step is intuitive and easy for the user to follow, reducing drop-offs.
- **High Engagement:** WhatsApp enables real-time, personal communication, which builds trust quickly.
- **Fast Conversion:** The process is streamlined, moving leads from awareness to action without unnecessary delays.

This 3-hop funnel is simple but powerful. By meeting users where they are and guiding them step by step, you can generate high-quality leads and boost your conversion rates.

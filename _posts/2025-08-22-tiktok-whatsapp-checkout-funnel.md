In today’s digital landscape, capturing leads efficiently is more important than ever. One of the most effective strategies we’ve seen is the “3-hop funnel” that moves users from TikTok to WhatsApp and finally to Checkout. Here’s how it works:

## Step 1: TikTok

Start by creating engaging short-form videos on TikTok. The goal is to capture attention and spark curiosity. Use clear calls-to-action that encourage viewers to click your profile link.

## Step 2: WhatsApp

The link in your TikTok profile should direct users to WhatsApp. Here, you can automate responses, answer questions, and build trust. WhatsApp offers a personal touch, making it easier to qualify leads and address objections in real time.

## Step 3: Checkout

Once the lead is ready, guide them to your checkout page. Keep the process simple and transparent. The fewer steps, the better the conversion rate.

## Why This Funnel Works

- **Low Friction:** Each step feels natural to the user.
- **High Engagement:** WhatsApp allows for direct, personal communication.
- **Fast Conversion:** The process is streamlined, reducing drop-offs.

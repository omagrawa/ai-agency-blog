Deploying AI in production means you need real guardrails—not just theory. Here’s how to implement practical, effective safeguards using regex, functions, and specialized tools.

## Step 1: Regex for Fast Filtering
- Use regular expressions to block obvious unsafe or unwanted patterns.
- Maintain a library of tested regexes for your use case (e.g., PII, profanity, code injection).

## Step 2: Functions for Contextual Checks
- Write custom functions to validate, sanitize, or transform AI outputs.
- Use functions to enforce business rules or compliance requirements.

## Step 3: Tools for Monitoring and Response
- Integrate third-party tools for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- Use dashboards to track incidents and continuously improve guardrails.

## Why This Works
- **Proven:** Regex and functions are fast, reliable, and easy to audit.
- **Layered:** Multiple guardrails catch more issues than any single method.
- **Actionable:** You can respond quickly to new risks as they emerge.
